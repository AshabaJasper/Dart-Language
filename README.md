 # Learning Dart Language    
## Introduction
Welcome to your Dart learning repository! This repository is designed to help you master the Dart language, focusing on its core concepts and practical applications. The learning plan is divided into four detailed lessons, each covering essential aspects of Dart programming. Additionally, five project ideas are provided to apply what you learn in real-world scenarios.

## Project Ideas

### Project 1: Simple Calculator
**Description:** Build a command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Project 2: Todo List Application
**Description:** Create a simple command-line todo list application where users can add, view, edit, and delete tasks.

### Project 3: Contacts Manager
**Description:** Develop a command-line application to manage a list of contacts. Features should include adding, searching, updating, and deleting contacts.

### Project 4: Weather App
**Description:** Build a command-line weather application that fetches and displays weather information for a given city using an external API.

### Project 5: File I/O Operations
**Description:** Create a command-line application to read from and write to files. Implement features to log user activities or store user data persistently.

## Conclusion
By following these lessons and completing the projects, you will gain a solid foundation in Dart programming. Practice each lesson thoroughly and apply your knowledge through the projects to enhance your understanding and proficiency. Happy coding!
